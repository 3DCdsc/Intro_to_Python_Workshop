    "Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. Most importantly, it does not require a setup and the notebooks that you create can be simultaneously edited by your team members - just the way you edit documents in Google Docs.

A detailed explanation can be found [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook). Alternatively, you can find the download link [here](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n",
